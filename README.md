Covid- 19 is the virus that came out of nowhere and forced the entire world into partial or complete lockdown. India has been one of the most affected countries in terms of either cases or deaths. In this project, we aim to find the most affected states within india and plot a map indicating the affect of the virus in variuos staes. This projecct has been  done to analyse the statistics by ourselves and see what the numbers had to say. 

The data set has been taken from the website https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/unofficial/covid19india.org/statewise

Below is the link to the notebook - which includes the map (indicating the virus's affect)
